While we unfortunately do not have a formal bug bounty or vulnerability disclosure program just yet, we do take security seriously.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability in Hacktron, please report it to us privately at [hello@hacktron.ai](mailto:hello@hacktron.ai).

We will investigate all reports and do our best to fix the issue as soon as possible. We will credit you in the Hall of Fame below.
