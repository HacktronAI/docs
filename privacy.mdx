## Compliance

We are **SOC 2** compliant, and are currently in the process of getting certified. Our auditor is [Insight Assurance](https://insightassurance.com/) and the certification is expected to be completed by 12/10/2025.

You can view our engagement letter and continuous, real-time evidence of our active controls from Vanta in our [Trust Center](https://trust.hacktron.ai).

## AI Providers

We use the following AI providers:

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
- [Google](https://ai.google.dev/)

We do not allow them to train on our data, and have signed **Zero Data Retention (ZDR)** agreements with all of them.
This means that data will not be logged for human review and will not be saved to disk or retained on their servers.

More information is available upon request.
