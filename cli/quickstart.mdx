## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal open
- An account on the [Hacktron Platform](https://app.hacktron.ai)

## Get started in three steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Hacktron CLI">

<Warning>
  If you are on Windows, you need to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
</Warning>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.hacktron.ai/install.sh | bash
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    hacktron --version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to your account">
    The Hacktron CLI requires an account on the [Hacktron Platform](https://app.hacktron.ai).
    You only need to login once, and the CLI will remember your credentials.

    ```bash
    hacktron login
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Start your first session

Open your terminal in any directory containing code you want to scan, and start the Hacktron CLI.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
hacktron
```

## Give your first task

You are now in an interactive session. Try one of these commands:

```text
Check for XSS vulnerabilities
```

Hacktron will analyse the codebase and perform a vulnerability scan, using taint analysis to find potential vulnerabilities.

You can also ask more general questions to understand the codebase.

```text
What technologies does this project use?
```

```text
What are the API endpoints?
```
