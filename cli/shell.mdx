## Shell mode

When in an interactive session, you can enter shell mode by typing `!`.

Once in shell mode, you can run shell commands by typing them directly.

```bash
whoami
```

To exit shell mode, press the `ESC` key.

## Execution modes

The CLI can run commands on behalf of the AI agent.

To allow Hacktron to run commands, run the CLI with the `--insecure` flag.

```bash
hacktron --insecure
```

Each command will still require your explicit approval.

To run commands automatically without approval, run the CLI with the `--auto-exec` flag.
Note that this is dangerous and should only be used if you trust the codebase, or are running in a secure environment.

```bash
hacktron --auto-exec
```
