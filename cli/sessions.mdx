## What are sessions?

Sessions are automatically saved when you exit the CLI and can be restored to continue where you left off.

You can see a list of your saved sessions by running:

```bash
hacktron sessions list
```

This will output a list of your saved sessions, including the pack name, run ID, and last updated time.

```text
Saved Sessions

• my-agent-name
  Pack: my-agent-name
  Run ID: <run-id> | Messages: 100 | Updated: 1 hour ago

• tui-session-1763477833405643777
  Interactive session - test
  Run ID: <run-id> | Messages: 200 | Updated: 1 day ago
```

## Restoring Sessions

You can restore a session by providing the run ID:

```bash
hacktron sessions restore tui-session-1763476909486569264
```

This will restore all messages from the session, and you can continue the conversation from there.

## Managing Sessions

To delete a specific session, run:

```bash
hacktron sessions delete tui-session-1763476909486569264
```

You can also clean up your sessions by deleting all sessions older than a certain number of days.
For example, to delete all sessions older than 30 days, run:

```bash
hacktron sessions clean --days 30
