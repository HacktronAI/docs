## What are Agent Packs?

Hacktron Agent Packs are collections of powerful agents designed to identify specific types of vulnerabilities. 
They rely on Hacktron's proprietary knowledge base, with contributions from our world-class security researchers.

## Using Agent Packs

When you give Hacktron a task in an interactive session, it will automatically find and use the most appropriate agents to perform the task.
However, you can also specify agent packs, such as `react`, which will run a collection of agents to find vulnerabilities in React applications.

This is useful if you know what technologies you are using, or want to focus on a specific type of vulnerability.

To see the list of available agent packs, run:

```bash
hacktron agent list --public
```

To run a specific agent pack, specify its name after the `--agents` flag:

```bash
hacktron --agents react
```

## Personal Agents

Hacktron learns from collaborating with you and automatically creates personal agents customised to your codebase.

These agents are dynamically created when you use Hacktron. You can see a list of your personal agents by running:

```bash
hacktron agent list --my-agents
```
