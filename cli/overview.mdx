## Agent Packs

Agent packs are collections of agents for specific technologies or types of vulnerabilities.

Hacktron's community agents are available to all users and are continually updated to keep up to date with the latest vulnerabilities and security research.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Community agents" icon="globe">
    We continually perform security research, finding zero-day vulnerabilities in products like **ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity's Comet Browser, Windsurf, and Lovable**.

    Beyond standard vulnerability patterns, we synthesise our novel findings into agent packs that can be used to find similar vulnerabilities in your codebase.

    This ensures that Hacktron can find **variants of real vulnerabilities that top engineering teams have missed**.
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Personal agents" icon="user">
    Hacktron **learns from collaborating with you** and automatically creates personal agents customised to your codebase.

    These agents are dynamically created when you use Hacktron, and are **private to you**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Actionable Findings

The CLI stores all findings securely in your local filesystem.

<Card img="/images/cli_finding.png">
  All findings are **validated**, and come with **code snippets, proof-of-concept exploits, and remediation steps**.
</Card>

## Takes Action

<Warning>
  Needs to be explicitly enabled with the `--insecure` flag. Only use this if you trust the codebase, or are running in a secure environment.
</Warning>

Hacktron's agents can **directly read files, run commands, and write exploit scripts**.
It works directly in your terminal, and you can also run your own shell commands while interacting with the CLI.
